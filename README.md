# ⚾ Swing Probability in Baseball  
**Author:** Danilo Arruda, PhD  

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project develops a **Swing Probability Model** in baseball using historical data from **three Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons**.  
The model predicts the likelihood that a batter will swing at a given pitch, based on pitch characteristics, count context, and player information.  
Beyond prediction, the project also explores **feature importance and interpretability** using SHAP values to understand what drives swing decisions.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
Understanding swing behavior is valuable for:
- **Teams and coaches**, to tailor pitching strategies and player matchups.  
- **Analysts and scouts**, to identify players with disciplined or aggressive swing tendencies.  
- **Sports scientists**, to study decision-making and motor behavior under time constraints.

## ⚙️ Project and Data Description
The dataset is retrieved using the **`pybaseball`** package and includes pitch-level information from three MLB seasons:
- 2022 season (April–October)
- 2023 season (March–October)
- 2024 season (March–June)

Each pitch includes detailed features such as:
- **Pitch characteristics**: type, velocity, spin rate, spin axis, and release position.  
- **Pitch trajectory**: movement (pfx_x, pfx_z), plate location (plate_x, plate_z), and strike zone metrics (sz_top, sz_bot).  
- **Game context**: balls, strikes, outs, inning, and score.  
- **Player information**: batter, pitcher, handedness (stand and p_throws).

The **target variable** is a binary indicator representing whether the batter **swung (1)** or **did not swing (0)**.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
Key preprocessing steps:
- Data fetched from Statcast via `pybaseball.statcast()`.
- Selection of relevant features for swing behavior.
- Handling missing values (rows with few NaNs dropped).
- Creation of the binary target variable (`swing`).
- Conversion of categorical features into dummy variables for modeling.

---

## 🤖 Modeling
Four classification models were initially trained and compared:
- **LightGBM**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

LightGBM achieved the best performance (≈ **85% accuracy**) and was selected for further optimization using **Bayesian hyperparameter tuning** via `skopt.BayesSearchCV`.

---

## 🔧 Model Calibration
Since the final goal is to predict **probabilities**, model calibration was performed using **isotonic regression** with cross-validation (`cv=20`) to improve probability reliability.  
The calibrated model was then used to evaluate accuracy and Brier score.

**Performance summary:**
- Accuracy: ~0.85  
- Brier Score: ~0.106  
- ROC-AUC: High discrimination between swing/no-swing classes.

---

## 📊 Model Diagnostics
- **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** confirmed balanced accuracy between classes.  
- **ROC Curve** showed strong separability between swing outcomes.  
- **Calibration Curve** verified that predicted probabilities align closely with observed outcomes.

---

## 🧩 Predicting Swing Probability for Year 3
The trained and calibrated LightGBM model was applied to **2024 (Year 3)** data to predict swing probabilities.  
Predictions correctly identified actual swing decisions **~80% of the time**, consistent with training performance.

A threshold-based evaluation (0.5 cutoff) illustrated how often model predictions matched real outcomes.

---

## 🔍 Feature Exploration
To interpret the model, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** was used.

### SHAP Beeswarm Plot
- **Strikes:** More strikes increase swing probability.  
- **Release speed:** Slower pitches slightly increase swing tendency.  
- **Strike zone top/bottom (sz_top, sz_bot):** Influence batter’s decision boundaries.  
- **Pitch type (e.g., sinkers)** tends to reduce swing probability.

### SHAP Dependence Plots
- **Strikes × Balls:** Swing probability increases sharply at two strikes, moderated by the number of balls.  
- **Release speed × Plate height:** Relationship is nonlinear (U-shaped); mid-range velocities increase swing likelihood.

These insights can guide **coaching strategies**, highlighting how pitch type, speed, and count context jointly shape swing behavior.
